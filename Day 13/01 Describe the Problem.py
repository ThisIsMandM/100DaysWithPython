my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? The i goes from 1 to 19 and checks if i is 20 to print the message?
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? Only if i is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? it goes from 1 to 19 and doesnt reach 20.
